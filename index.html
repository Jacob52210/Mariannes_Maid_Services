				"As a single mother of 3 and a manager at work, I am much too busy to
				tidy up and deep clean my house. So when I'm at work and the kids are at
				daycare/school, Marianne comes in and does the cleaning for me! I have
				peace in mind knowing all the work is done when I get home. She does a
				great job and is 100% trust worthy!"

			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				My name is Marianne C Bryan. I am the owner and operator of Marianne's
				Maid Service. I care about the health and well being of other's so I
				have decided to use my skills to clean homes for other people that can
				not or does not have the extra time. I graduated from Bryant and
				Stratton college in 2007 as a medical assistant. I was working in the
				medical field up until the loss of my late husband in 2017. I am trained
				in sterilization and organizing as well as being a mother to two
				children and a grandmother to 4 grandchildren. I typically try to use
				homemade remedies for my cleaning but due to the pandemic I have been
				having to use Lysol and bleach.<span id="gallery"></span> Outside of
				cleaning homes I like to spend quality time with my children and
				grandchildren as well as fishing and camping. I also enjoy cooking (I'm
				told I'm pretty good at cooking)
